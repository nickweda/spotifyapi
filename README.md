# My Spotify Data - Analyzing and building a Machine Learning Model

This Project is and end-to-end Data Science project, where I source my own personal Spotify song data using an API, and use the data to construct an Analytics Dashboard and build a Machine Learning Model which can predict if an unseen song will be among my top favorited songs.

The motivation behind this project is to do a self-analysis and learn more about my music preferences, and find out how likely I will be to liking new music. 

## Data Sourcing
- Spotify provides a [Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to request all of your saved song Data
- The [SpotiPy](https://github.com/spotipy-dev/spotipy) library provides a Python interface to this API

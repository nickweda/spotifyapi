Looker Studio can connect to a Postgres server on the cloud.

I setup a Supabase project and used the connector on Looker Studio.

CSV Issues - Column names need to be lower case and underscored instead of spaced.

Inside Looker Studio can run a custom query from my Postgres DB:

SELECT 
  artist_name,
  MIN(top_artist_ranking) AS best_rank
FROM public.spotify
WHERE top_artist_ranking IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY best_rank ASC

Problem: Though this completely replaces the main table.

On Supabase I can create a View:

SELECT 
  artist_name,
  MIN(top_artist_ranking) AS best_rank
FROM public.spotify
WHERE top_artist_ranking IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY best_rank ASC

Problem: Though I would need to re-login to the server on Looker Studio to add other tables.
This would be so much extra work for multiple custom tables to display on the Dashboard.

Apparently, Tableau does this all built in.

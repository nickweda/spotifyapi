Looker Studio Integrates better with BigQuery (Also from Google)

Can add multiple tables without having to re-auth.
Create Views in BigQuery then add in Looker Studio.

Is this still not ideal? Can I do everything on the fly in Tableau?

Steps:

https://console.cloud.google.com/
New project
https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery
Create Dataset
Upload CSV (automatically creates a SQL table)
In looker studio link to BigQuery
Add table into looker studio
Run the query in BigQuery and it creates a table
Repeat link to looker studio

This works but still isn't "on the fly"

Is Tableau what I'm looking for?

"Looker Studio is not built for modeling - it expects clean, ready-to-go datasets."
"Every “transformation” or join has to happen outside: in BigQuery, Supabase, or Sheets."
"It works fine for dashboards, but it's not great for data discovery and iteration."

"You can do analysis and visualization together, fast"

Analysis vs. Visualization????? Two seperate things?
